Interpolation
=============

Matlab code for Chebyshev interpolation, including Smolyak algorithm

This repository includes Matlab code that I have written for multidimensional function interpolation with Chebyshev polynomials.
It includes a implementation of the isotropic and the anisotropic Smolyak algorithms, as described by Judd et al. 2014.  Part of the code was adapted from Miranda & Fackler's CompEcon toolbox.
